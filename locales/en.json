I'm excited to be able to play this wonderful game for the fourth time, thanks, guys.”",

  "faq": {
    "span": "FAQ",
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "question1": "What is a 'cloud PC'?",
    "answer1": "A cloud PC is a virtual machine accessed remotely from your device, without regional limitations, providing accessibility and comfort, with all the services and functionalities of a regular computer, but without the need to have the physical product in hand.",
    "question2": "Can I update the system?",
    "answer2": "No, all system components including drivers are designed for the best performance of your machine; altering these settings may reduce performance and even break the machine. Moreover, it is considered improper use of our services.",
    "question3": "How does it work?",
    "answer3": "Our system allows you to connect your device directly to a computer on our server. This computer is designed to provide the best performance for your activities, such as gaming, work, and more.",
    "question4": "Does it work on Android and iOS?",
    "answer4": "Yes, on Android, the first access can be done via RDP or VNC and then move on to using Moonlight or Parsec. On iOS, the first access also occurs via Remote Desktop or VNC, but it is not possible to use Moonlight and Parsec; the only compatible streaming app for iOS is Steam Link.",
    "question5": "Can I play using RDP or VNC?",
    "answer5": "No, RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) and VNC (Virtual Network Computing) are only used for the first access, allowing you to link your Parsec, Moonlight, and Steam Link accounts. After linking your accounts, you must close RDP or VNC and play exclusively using Parsec, Moonlight, or Steam Link.",
    "question6": "Why use a cloud PC?",
    "answer6": "The costs to have a computer like those from Space Cloud, physically in hand, would reach around R$12,000, not to mention the maintenance costs that will come with usage over time; therefore, a cloud computer is much more cost-effective.",
    "question7": "What is a Preemptive instance?",
    "answer7": "Preemptive VM instances are a more affordable variant of standard VMs because these instances can be interrupted by the Compute Engine to recover computing capacity to redirect them to other VMs.",
    "question8": "Will I lose my files when I shut down the machine?",
    "answer8": "No, our services include saving your files in a 100% secure manner; just allocate these files and documents on one of the machine's hard drives, so your game files, work documents, and projects are not lost when you shut down or restart your machine.",
    "question9": "Is there a login queue system?",
    "answer9": "No, to make your experience more comfortable, we work without waiting queues, so you can access your machine whenever and wherever you want without wasting much of your time just for a login."
